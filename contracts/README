This version of the Basis Cash contracts makes the following changes: 

- Change the Solidity compiler version to 0.6.2 from 0.6.0
- Use the full path for OpenZeppelin contracts instead of a local install

This helps run these files directly in Remix without having to run Truffle locally. It is also more explicit in terms of which version of the contracts are being used - in this case, the OpenZeppelin contracts v3.2.0. This information is not apparent with Truffle.
